Code and analysis used in the study:  
**"Shelf water carbon export from the Atlantic and Pacific Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems: a satellite-based estimation"**  
Submitted to *Geophysical Research Letters (GRL)*.

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains the core scripts and routines used to detect filamentary structures and analyze their role in offshore carbon export in the Eastern Boundary Upwelling systems (EBUS). The analysis is based on satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean color data (Chl-a and KD490). Data can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/records/15194632).

The methodology includes:
- Preprocessing and masking of satellite fields  
- Clustering and identification of mesoscale and submesoscale filamentary structures
- Estimation and analysis of the associated lateral carbon transport

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Data availability

The raw input time series datasets (OC-CCI, MODIS-Aqua) are not included in this repository due to size constraints, but instructions and scripts to download the datasets are available in the "download_process_files" folder.
