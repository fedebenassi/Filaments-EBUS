Code and analysis used in the study:  
**"Shelf water carbon export from the Atlantic and Pacific Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems: a satellite-based estimation"**  
Submitted to *Geophysical Research Letters (GRL)*.

## 📖 Overview

This repository contains the core scripts and routines used to detect filamentary structures and analyze their role in offshore carbon export in the Eastern Boundary Upwelling systems (EBUS). The analysis is based on satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean color data (Chl-a and KD490). Data can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/records/15194632).

The methodology includes:
- Raw data download
- Preprocessing and masking of satellite fields  
- Clustering and identification of mesoscale and submesoscale filamentary structures
- Estimation and analysis of the associated lateral carbon transport
